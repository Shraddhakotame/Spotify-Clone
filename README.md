🎧 Spotify Clone – Responsive Music UI

“Code is like music — when every line is in harmony, the whole project sings.”

After several days of fixing layouts, resizing elements, and battling countless errors —
I finally made my Spotify Clone using HTML, CSS & JavaScript! ✨

This project tested my patience but taught me much more than just code.
Now I’m polishing the UI further and adding more interactive features. 🚀🎶

“Progress is slow… but quitting won’t make it faster.”

✅ Completed Features

-Desktop UI with Spotify-like layout
-Functional music player: Play / Pause / Next / Previous
-Seekbar + current time & duration
-Volume control & mute
-Song list loaded dynamically
-Playlist rendering from folder
-Hover effects & clean dark theme
-SVG icons for controls + UI elements

✅ In Progress / Planned (WIP)

-Making layout responsive for mobile and tablet (currently desktop-only layout)
-Ensure UI works well on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet)
-Adaptive grid or flex layout for playlist and main container
-UI polish: fluid width/height, responsive icons & images, maintain aspect ratio
-Possibly add more interactive features (e.g. dynamic playlist management, touch controls)
